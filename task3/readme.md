## 🧠 Task Objective  

The objectives of this task are to:

- Apply **K-means** to large-scale fire detection data
- Apply **db-scan** to large-scale fire detection data  
- Apply **CLARA** to large-scale fire detection data  
- Discover natural groupings between **fire** and **no-fire** patterns  
- Evaluate clustering quality using:
  - Silhouette Score  
  - Davies–Bouldin Index  
  - Calinski–Harabasz Index  
  - ARI and NMI (against ground truth labels)  
- Study how well unsupervised clustering aligns with the real classes
